## Hello, hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Northwestern University's [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/), where I explore the nature of Dark Matter and its role in Galaxy Formation and Evolution, especially at the smallest scales. My research involves developing machine learning techniques to analyze cosmological simulations and data from astronomical surveys.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Physics (Astrophysics Divison) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Lina Necib](https://lnecib.com/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
